## 1. Introduction (介绍)

Have you ever been troubled by how to allocate a week's time to different things when making phased life plans?
Perhaps when you schedule your time, you may find that some tasks/plans are more likely to occur in the morning or evening, 
while others should take more time due to approaching deadlines, and so on...
This project 'time allocation' was born to solve this problem.
