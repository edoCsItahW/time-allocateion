Time Allocateion (时间分配)
----

## 1. Introduction (介绍)

Have you ever been troubled by how to allocate a week's time to different things when making phased life plans?
Perhaps when you schedule your time, you may find that some tasks/plans are more likely to occur in the morning or evening, 
while others should take more time due to approaching deadlines, and so on...
This project 'time allocation' was born to solve this problem.

你是否曾在做生活的阶段性规划时为如何将一周的时间分配至不同的事情上而烦恼？
或许当你安排时间时发现有的任务/计划更应该发生在早上或晚上，而一些任务因为临近时限而应该花费更多时间等等···
这个项目'时间分配'就是为了解决这个问题而诞生的。
